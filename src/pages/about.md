So yeah, I started getting interested in computers when I was just 14, creating Minecraft servers was everything I wanted for life at that moment.

After 10 years, I have two cats a beautiful partner and I've ended up becoming a web developer! With three years in the industry I've tested a lot of things, and every day I notice how much I can still learn to improve myself as a professional and as a person.

Throughout my career I've had the chance to work with awesome people, learning from frontend to backend and a little bit of DevOps, going from a little software factory
to a big multinational and now I just prefer a good small team that I can share with and give value to the user (If you want to know more about my work history please check out my CV).

I love to solve problems, investigate and research, test and break things, everything that involves discovery just thrives me, but please, don't ask me to do
something complex with CSS I just suck at it (this page is a living example of it).

My main focus over the last three years has been to understand Javascript and to be able to use it to create awesome applications, and I hope someday I can
use it to create awesome developer tools that can help the community as the community helped me when I was just learning web development.

I'm writing this about at 2:13 AM so I don't want to make this eternal for me or for you, so I hope you managed to learn a little bit more from me with this!
And please, don't doubt to reach out if you want to know more about me üëç
