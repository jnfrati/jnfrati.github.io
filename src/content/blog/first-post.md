So yeah, as you might imagine, this is not a blog post.
I just wanted to build something quick enough so I ended up using the astro template, but I'm also lazy enough so I don't
want to type the post structure (basically I will leave this post so I don't forget how to add a new one at some point lol).

Although this is by pure lazyness I do plan to start adding some posts so wait for it!
